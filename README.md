# Adform-GA4-TECHNICAL-STATISTICS-DIFFERENCES
For some time we have been running campaigns in Adform, among others, and over time we started to lose traffic.

I have a problem where my stats between Adform RTB platform and new GA4 disappear. Differences (depending on the day) oscillate in between the range of 40-50%. I'm trying to locate the source of the problem and I wanted to ask if any of you had a similar problem maybe and if you managed to solve it somehow. Thanks. :)
